My name is Yuxuan Wang, and I am originally from Wuhan, which is a big city in central China. Currently, I am a senior student at Babson College, and my
concentrations are business analytics and quantitative methods.This website I built is for my course, Web Tech. Because I am really interested 
in data science, I decided to build my website for introducing data science to students who's also intrested in it. Data Science is a newly developed, but
highly important field. I spent a long time on building skill for it, and I want to work in this field in the future.
<br><br>
In the spare time, I love travel and food. I've already been to many countries in the world, and I enjoy the different sightseeing, cultures and foods.
I am willing to try all kinds of food, and I'd like to cook for myself and my friends and families.

runs and dissolves a company.
